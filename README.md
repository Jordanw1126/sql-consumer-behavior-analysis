# 🧠 Consumer Behavior Analysis – SQL-Only Project

This project explores consumer behavior through SQL-based data analysis. Using raw SQL queries, I examined patterns in purchase activity, social media influence, income levels, device usage, and customer segmentation to uncover insights and deliver business recommendations — all without relying on dashboards or visualization tools.

- **Income vs Spending:** High- and middle-income customers showed nearly identical average spend, indicating opportunity for similar targeting.
- **Social Media Influence:** Middle-aged consumers (35–44) were most influenced by social media, more than even younger users.
- **Shopping Channels:** Most users engaged with a mixed (online + in-store) channel strategy.
- **Device & Decision Time:** Mobile users took the longest to decide, signaling possible friction in the mobile UX flow.
